# COVID-19_SATX - Front End

This is a very simple react application designed to simplify the COVID-19 data for San Antonio, TX. 

## Installation

This application uses React, so make sure you have Node installed on your device first then run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
To run simply run the following command:
```python
npm start
```

##Where is the data coming from?
As of right now, the data is coming from scraping the City of San Antonio's COVID-19 website.
As of this moment the City of San Antonio does not offer an API or any a way to pull the data for the cases of COVID-19 in San Antonio. 
The scraping data is generated by this [project](https://github.com/derek-diaz/COVID-19_SATX-Parser).
